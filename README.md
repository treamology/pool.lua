Example

```
local pool = require "pool"

local function newObject()
	local obj = {
		foo = "bar",
		reset = function()
			print("reset!")
		end
	}
	return obj
end

local objectPool = pool.create(newObject, 32)
local object = objectPool:obtain()

print(object.foo)

objectPool:free(object)
```

Explanation
===========
Object pools are useful for objects that are frequently being created and destroyed (for instance, bullets in a game). Using pools in a situation where creating and destroying instances are expensive can offer a performance boost. For more about object pooling, look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern).

Creating a pool
---------------
Naturally, a pool must be created before it can be used.

`pool.create(newObjectFunc, numObjects)`: Creates a pool.
* `newObjectFunc` is a function that must return the object that is to be inserted into the pool.
* `numObjects` is the number of objects that will be immediately added into the pool. By default, this is 16.

Obtaining and freeing objects
-----------------------------
Now that a pool has been created, we can take and put back objects from and into the pool.

`pool:obtain()`: Obtains an object from the set of currently free objects.

`pool:free(object)`: Puts an object back into the pool for later use.
* `object` is the object to be freed
* If the object being freed contains a function named `reset`, it will be called when it is added back into the pool. Use this to reset any values on the object that you don't want sticking around between uses.

Purging objects from a pool
---------------------------
The pool of free objects can also be cleared.

`pool:clear()`: Clears the free object pool.

Usage
=====
Copy/paste pool.lua into your source folder, then use

    local pool = require "pool"
    
wherever you need it.
